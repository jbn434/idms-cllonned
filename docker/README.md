# 📦 License API – Docker Setup

This project is a NestJS-based License API. The application is containerized using Docker and can be easily built and run locally or in a deployment environment.

## 🐳 Dockerfile Overview

The Dockerfile is located at `idms/docker/Dockerfile` and does the following:

- Uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image
- Installs PostgreSQL client (if needed by your app)
- Sets working directory to `/app`
- Installs Node.js dependencies
- Copies source code
- Builds the app using `npm run build`
- Exposes port `4000`
- Starts the app using `npm run start:prod`

---

## 🚀 How to Build and Run the App

### Step 1: Navigate to the `docker/` folder

```bash
cd idms/docker
docker build -t license-api .
docker run -p 4000:4000 license-api
The app will be available at:
http://localhost:4000

⚙️ Available Commands

npm install	Installs dependencies
npm run build	Builds the NestJS project
npm run start:prod	Starts the app in prod mode


📦 Docker Compose Overview (Services & Workflow)
This docker-compose.yml defines a two-service application: a PostgreSQL database and a Node.js API.

🗄️ PostgreSQL Service (postgres)
Image: Uses the official latest PostgreSQL Docker image.

Container Name: Named postgres.

Environment Configuration:

Loads environment variables from .env.

Sets database user, password, and name via:

POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USERNAME}

POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}

POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}

Health Check:

Uses pg_isready to ensure PostgreSQL is ready before other services depend on it.

Ports:

Maps container port 5432 to host port 5432 for DB access.

Volumes:

Persists data via a Docker volume pgdata.

🚀 API Application Service (app)
Image: Uses a custom-built image named api:latest.

Build Context:

Builds from Dockerfile located at docker/Dockerfile with root context as ...

Container Name: Named api.

Restart Policy: Always restarts on failure or container stop.

Ports:

Exposes port 4000 on the host.

Dependencies:

Waits for the postgres service to become healthy before starting.

Environment:

Loads environment variables from .env.

🗃️ Volumes
pgdata:

Named volume used by the postgres container to persist database data across restarts.
